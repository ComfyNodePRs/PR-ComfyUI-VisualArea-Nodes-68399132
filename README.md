# ComfyUI Visual Area Nodes 

## Overview

This extension introduces custom nodes that provide enhanced control over area-based conditioning in ComfyUI. These nodes allow for more precise management of areas of influence by visually defining their scope. Additionally, a compact visual panel is included to preview how these areas will be positioned and scaled within the image.

## Installation

1. **Enter the custom nodes directory for ComfyUI (found in the program's installation directory)**:
   ```bash
   cd custom_nodes
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fuwuffyi/ComfyUI-VisualArea-Nodes.git
   ```

3. **Restart ComfyUI**
