# ComfyUI Visual Area Nodes 

## Overview

This extension adds custom nodes to ComfyUI that offer enhanced control over area-based conditioning. With these nodes, you can precisely manage areas of influence by visually defining their scope. The extension also includes a compact visual panel for previewing how these areas will be positioned and scaled within the image.

The development of these nodes was heavily inspired by [**Davemane42's Custom Nodes**](https://github.com/Davemane42/ComfyUI_Dave_CustomNode), with the goal of making those nodes accessible to everyone once again.

A special thanks to the [**cozy_ex_dynamic**](https://github.com/cozy-comfyui/cozy_ex_dynamic) repository, which provided invaluable guidance on creating nodes with dynamic inputs.
