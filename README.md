# ComfyUI Visual Area Nodes 

## Overview

This extension introduces custom nodes that provide enhanced control over area-based conditioning in ComfyUI. These nodes allow for more precise management of areas of influence by visually defining their scope. Additionally, a compact visual panel is included to preview how these areas will be positioned and scaled within the image.

These nodes are heavily inspired by [**Davemane42's Custom nodes**](https://github.com/Davemane42/ComfyUI_Dave_CustomNode), as I wanted to allow those nodes to work again for everyone to use.

Huge thanks to [**cozy_ex_dynamic**](https://github.com/cozy-comfyui/cozy_ex_dynamic) from which I learned how to make a node with dynamic inputs.
